                   gexec (version 0.5.4) March 26, 2019  
DESCRIPTION

   gexec is a program that displays a small interactive command execution dialog (aka "runner" or "runbox").
   Its features include a combobox to recall previously-used commandstrings from saved history, and UI tickboxes
   to optionally specify "run in terminal" and/or "run as  root".  An additional tickbox optionally enables
   "Keep Open this dialog after launch"; by default, gexec immediately closes the dialog and exits after
   launching the requested command.

   When "run as root" has been selected, gexec passes the requested command to gksu to obtain elevated permissions.

OPTIONS

   -h, --help
         Show summary of options

   -k, --keepopen
         Keep gexec open after executing a command

FILES

   ~/.config/gexec/gexec.conf
   ~/.config/gexec/gexec__history
   /usr/share/doc/gexec/README.md
   /usr/share/doc/gexec/gexec_manpage.txt
   /usr/bin/gexec
   /usr/share/man/man1/gexec.1.gz

CONFIGURATION

   The first time you launch gexec, it will (perform a check for available terminal emulator applications and)
   create a  ~/.config/gexec/gexec.conf file.  You can edit this file to specify a different terminal emulator
   program to be used by the gexec "Run in terminal" option.

   During each run, gexec populates a list of previously-executed commands to a
   ~/.config/gexec/gexec__history history list file.  By default, it will retain a list of 40 entries
   (duplicates of identical entries are not retained).  You can specify a different list length within gexec.conf
   and you can disable the gexec history feature by specifying zero (or 0, your choice) as the value.

   During each run, if the gexec.conf file is absent (due to accidental deletion, or exclusion during persist-save,
   snapshot, or remastering operation) gexec will regenerate the file, repopulating each of its settings with
   default values.

CHOOSING A COMPANION TERMINAL EMULATOR PROGRAM

   When choosing a terminal emulator program for use with the gexec "Run in Terminal" option, bear in mind that
   some do not support  copy-to-clipboard.  In that case, you can usually (i.e. across many terminal emulator
   programs that I have tested) highlight a portion of the terminal output, then switch to another window
   (keybind assigned to Alt+Tab in most desktop environments) and press mouse2 aka middle mouse button to
   paste the "selection text".

   Below are some tested, working, gexec.conf lines for a few terminal emulators, along with notes
   describing features/quirks related to each:

   roxterm --disable-sm -e %s
   supports Ctrl+Shift+C copy to clipboard
   quotes around passed cmd arg are optional (ok with, or without single//double-quoted cmd arg)

   urxvt -e %s
   does not support Ctrl+Shift+C copy to clipboard
   must NOT place quotes around the commandstring arg passed to urxvt

   xfce4-terminal -e
   supports Ctrl+Shift+C copy to clipboard
   xfce4-terminal demands use of quotes (single or double) for the passed commandstring arg

   xterm -e %s
   does not support Ctrl+Shift+C copy to clipboard
   quotes around passed cmd arg are optional (ok with, or without single//double-quoted cmd arg)

USAGE NOTES

          You should NEVER copy/paste web-snipped code directly into terminal, nor into gexec runbox !
